              She is a creative thinker ever since she was child.
              She was directed more towards art projects during her school. 
              Along with art, she also got interested in computer science and pursued
              her academic interest. After earning degree in computer science was wondering how to merge 
              both of her passions?
              After brainstorming the electives she came across the UX/UI field. This is the perfect field for her
              as both design and coding is involve in it. And now, she is ready to help users 
              for their pleasant experience throughout the process. By using her skills, 
              she can create better user experience and  can also collaborate with the developers easily to help 
              them troubleshoot the problems.
